 # SQLGo: A Python Tool for Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

## Introduction

SQLGo is a Python tool designed to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It employs a combination of crawling and fuzzing techniques to identify potential injection points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Installation

To install SQLGo, simply clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/sqlgo/sqlgo.git
```

## Usage

To use SQLGo, you will need to provide the URL of the web application you want to test. You can do this by specifying the `-u` or `--url` flag when running the tool. For example:

```
python sqlgo.py -u http://example.com
```

SQLGo will then start crawling the web application, looking for potential injection points. Once it has identified a potential injection point, it will attempt to exploit it by injecting a malicious payload. If the injection is successful, SQLGo will display the results, including the sensitive data that was accessed.

## Example

Let's consider the following example code:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.getcwd())
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import lib.core.setting.setting as settings
from lib.logger.log import logger
from lib.core.tester.detector import sqlInjectionBasicDetection
from extra.bs4funs import get_form_from_response
from extra.bs4funs import *  # Import the missing function
from lib.core.tester.XSSfuns import getAllForms, 
import random
from extra.useragents import useragents
from thirdparty.colorama import Fore,init
from lib.core.parser.cmdline import url as _url
import socket
import thirdparty.requests as requests
from extra.logo import logo

init()

class Crawler:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self._useragent = useragents()
        self.url = url
        self._parsed_url = None
        self.headers = {settings.HTTP_HEADERS[0]: random.choice(settings.USER_AGENT_LIST)}
        self.request = urllib.request.Request(url)

    def _user_agent(self):
        pass
